# HelloNeuralNetworks
An introductory collection of Neural Networks programs.

**Number Detector**: Four layer neural network made with Keras to detect hand-written numbers 0-9. My Neural Networks "Hello World" if you will.

_Topics Covered_
- *XOR Challenge and non-linear activation solution*
- *Gradient Descent*
- *Weighted sums*
- *Activation functions: Sigmoid, hyperbolic tangent, linear, and relu*
- *Perceptrons, neurons, and layer types and their effects on learning rates*
